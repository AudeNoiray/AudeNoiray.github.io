I am a researcher at the [Laboratoire de Psychologie & Neurocognition](https://lpnc.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/fr) at the University Grenoble Alpes (UGA). I am a member of the [Babylab](https://lpnc.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/fr/babylab) as well as the Développement & Apprentissage and Language teams.
My research interests revolve around the development of spoken language fluency in (a)typically developing children. I study the developing relationships between speech motor control and other language-related abilities such as perception, phonology, lexicon, and reading. I also researches on vocal development in infants, speech production and speech perception in pathological speech (Parkinson, post-stroke or post Schwanome tumor patients).

My research is empirically grounded; I employ various methods such as audiovisual recordings, ultrasound imaging, eye-tracking, assessments of language and reading abilities, or perception tests.
