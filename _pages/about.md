I am a researcher at the [Laboratoire de Psychologie & Neurocognition](https://lpnc.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/fr) at the University Grenoble Alpes (UGA). I am a member of the [Babylab](https://lpnc.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/fr/babylab) as well as the DÃ©veloppement & Apprentissage and Language teams.

My research interests revolve around the development of spoken language fluency in (a)typically developing children. I study the (developing) relationships between speech motor control and other language-related abilities such as perception, phonology, lexicon, and reading. Other interests include speech and language deficiencies in adults (for instance in Parkinson disease and post-stroke patients), speech planning, or embodied language.  
My research is empirically grounded; I employ various methods such as audiovisual recordings, ultrasound imaging, eye-tracking, assessments of language and reading abilities, or perception tests.

Outside the lab, I love to hike. Growing up in the Alps, I have been spoiled with a wide range of landscapes. There is nothing more energising, inspi and relaxing for me than being in the mountains.

In past years, I have also become a passionate dancer. Thanks to dance, I have broadened my perspectives on both language and motor control.
