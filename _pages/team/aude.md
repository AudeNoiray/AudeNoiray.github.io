## Aude Noiray

I am a researcher at the [Laboratoire de Psychologie & Neurocognition](https://lpnc.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/fr) (LPNC) at the University Grenoble Alpes (UGA). I am a member of the [Babylab](https://lpnc.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/fr/babylab) as well as the [DÃ©veloppement & Apprentissage](https://lpnc.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/fr/recherche-0/equipes-recherche/equipe-developpement-et-apprentissage) and [Language](https://lpnc.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/fr/recherche-0/equipes-recherche/equipe-langage) teams.

I am passionate about speech, language, and their development. My research lies at the intersection of several disciplines, including experimental, articulatory and acoustic phonetics; psycholinguistics; laboratory phonology; developmental psychology and biology.
My current research focuses on the (a)typical development of spoken language fluency. I study the evolving connections between speech motor control and other language-related skills, such as perception, phonology, vocabulary and reading. I also conduct research on vocal development in infants, on speech production and perception in patients with pathological speech, such as those with Parkinson's disease, strokes or brain tumours.
My research is empirically grounded. I use various methods, such as audiovisual recordings, ultrasound imaging, eye tracking, and assessments of language and reading abilities.
