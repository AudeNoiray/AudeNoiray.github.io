## [Elina Rubertus (postdoctoral fellow)](https://elinarubertus.github.io/)

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the bilateral French-German ANR/DFG-funded project VOC2SPEAK - An integrative-interactive approach to speech development at Leibniz-Zentrum Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft [ZAS Berlin](https://www.leibniz-zas.de/de/). We will have a closer look at interactions of respiration, body movements, attention, and speech motor control with vocalizations and early speech in infancy.
