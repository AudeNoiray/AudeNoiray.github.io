Dr. Susanne Fuchs is a senior researcher in the Research Area 1 'Laboratory Phonology'. At ZAS she also heads the DFG project [On the Flexibility and Stability of gesture-speech coordination: Evidence from production, comprehension, and imitation (FLESH)](https://www.leibniz-zas.de/en/research/research-areas/laboratory-phonology/flesh) and the ANR-DFG project [An integrative-interactive approach to speech development (VOC2SPEAK)](https://www.leibniz-zas.de/en/research/research-areas/laboratory-phonology/voc2speak).
The main focus of Susanne Fuchs' research are the biopsychosocial foundations of speech and language and their multimodal manifestations in human interactions. In more recent works, Susanne Fuchs is increasingly considering the situational context, such as simultaneous speech and movement, and she tries to apply her results to everyday situations. She follows theories of embodiment without losing sight of other approaches.
