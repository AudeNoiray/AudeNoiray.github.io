In this research, we consider that spoken language development between language-related abilities.

In the first decade of life, multiple competences in the speech motor, perception, lexical and phonological domains occur in a seemingly parallel fashion. While their development has mostly been conducted in separate strands, the findings suggest that they interact at various stages of spoken language development. In this research, <strong>we assessed whether the development of phonological awareness and children’s vocabulary interacts with the maturation of coarticulatory organization in typically developing children</strong>.

Phonological awareness relates to the ability to consciously extract functional units of phonological organization from the continuous speech flow (e.g., syllables, segments) and combine those discrete units into new sequences of variable size and meaning (e.g., Metsala, 2011). Coarticulation embodies speakers´ structural knowledge of the language, combining and (re)modeling its elementary particles into continuous articulatory movements and acoustic streams, hence contextualizing abstract representations into a decipherable speech code. Interestingly, the way coarticulatory organization changes over developmental time aligns well with children’s phonological developments.

In a second step, we tested for <strong>a possible relationship between children’s reading ability and their coarticulatory organization</strong> at a time both processes undergo major developments. I addressed this question in German because in alphabetical languages with consistent grapheme-to-phoneme relationships (e.g., German, Spanish) reading aloud recruits similar phonemes to speech motor gestures correspondences as casual speech contrary to opaque orthographies (e.g., French) for which there is no systematic one-on-one mapping between graphemes and phonemes.
