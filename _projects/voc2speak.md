Speech development is shaped by multiple interactions between sensory, motor, cognitive and language skills. While the individual development of these skills has been relatively well studied in recent decades, many questions remain about their interactions.
The first three years of life are crucial for the development of language perception and production and the detection of possible deficiencies. The main aim of the VOC2SPEAK project is to study the early development of speech motor coordination and its interaction with attention, lexical and phonological development within a cross-linguistic perspective.

This interdisciplinary project brings together a dynamic team of researchers in developmental psycholinguistics, speech motor control, speech production, respiration, audiovisual perception and modelling, mainly in France and Germany with collaborators in Sweden and the Netherlands.

Within the project, two post-doctoral fellows as well as a PhD candidate will carry out several behavioural studies with infants aged between 6 and 36 months, using different experimental techniques such as eye-movement tracking, ultrasound imaging and audiovisual recordings.
